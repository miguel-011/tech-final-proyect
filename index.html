 <p>Proyecto de Biografia</p>
     <p> I am miguel alejandro montoya, I come from Honduras and feel mostly like a cat, lazy, shy and with an urge to sleep every now and then. I was born in La Ceiba
        Honduras, I have always been alone for almost 6 years, until I had a little brother called Abraham Jose, he made me feel unalone, and made me happy. At a young age
        I was aware of alot more things than the average 6 year old. I learn how to play chess when I was 6, learned how the pieces moved, but only played it for 1 month. After 
        that I learned basic math, but had very few friends. When I was 7.5 years old, I moved to Guatemala, and made friends like Julio Manuel, Jose Fernando, Pedro Pablo, Javier Ivan
        , and more at CAS. I spent 6 years studying at CAS, and then my family moved to ecuador, spent a year living there and then moved back to Guatemala, where Im currently trying
        to do something good with my life apart from chess.</p>
